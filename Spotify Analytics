# I downloaded the Spotify data from Kaggle to start of this project
# Then I creadted a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# And then I answered the following question using the following SQL.

#1. Which Artist/s has more than 2 songs on Spotify top 50?
SELECT artist_name, Count(artist_name) AS no_of_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY artist_name
HAVING no_of_songs >2
ORDER BY no_of_songs;
#2. Who are the top 10 most popular artists and their songs on the list?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity asc 
LIMIT 10;
#3. What track of Olivia Rodrigo is the easiest to dance to?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE artist_name  = ""Olivia Rodrigo""
GROUP BY track_name 
ORDER BY danceability desc 
LIMIT 1;
#4. What track of Ed Sheeran entered the Spotify top 50?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Ed Sheeran';
#5. What is the average danceability and energy by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, 
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
