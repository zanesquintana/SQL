# Hi, here you can see queries I made to analyze Membership Booking Facilities to get the necessary data.

#1. You want to print out a list of all of the facilities and their cost to members. How would you retrieve a list of only facility names and costs?
   SELECT name, membercost FROM cd.facilities

#2. How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members?
   SELECT * FROM cd.facilities
  WHERE membercost> 0;

#3. How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, 
facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question. 
    SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance FROM cd.facilities
    WHERE membercost > 0 
    AND membercost < (monthlymaintenance/50.0);

#4. How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?
    SELECT * FROM cd.facilities
    WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';

#5. How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of 
September 2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.
    SELECT memid, surname, firstname,joindate FROM cd.members
    WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';

#6. Produce a list of the total number of slots booked per facility in the month of September 2012. 
Produce an output table consisting of facility id and slots, sorted by the number of slots.
    SELECT facid, SUM(slots) FROM cd.bookings
    WHERE starttime >= '2012-09-01' AND starttime <= '2012-10-01'
    GROUP BY facid
    ORDER BY sum(slots)

#7.Produce a list of facilities with more than 1000 slots booked. Produce an output table consisting of facility id and total slots, sorted by facility id.
    SELECT facid, SUM(slots) FROM cd.bookings
    GROUP BY facid
    HAVING sum(slots) > 1000
    ORDER BY facid;

#8.How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, 
for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.
    SELECT starttime, name FROM cd.bookings b
    JOIN cd.facilities f
    ON b.facid=f.facid
    WHERE f.facid IN (0,1)
    AND starttime >= '2012-09-21' 
    AND starttime < '2012-09-22'
    ORDER BY starttime

#9. How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?
